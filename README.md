# DoodleBox
A tiny development environment for code doodles made with löve.

### Features
* A built keyboard driven code editor with lua syntax highlighting
* A console used for configuration and file management
* Writing and executing code all in the same window
* Various shorthands to commonly used functions to making doodling faster

Shoutout to [LoganDark](https://github.com/LoganDark/lua-lexer) for his [lua lexer](https://github.com/LoganDark/lua-lexer) which made implementing the syntax highlighting a breeze.
